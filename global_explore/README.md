## README Philippines [phl]

This folder contains information for Philippines from the OHI global assessments. [View the explore_data file](
https://raw.githack.com/OHI-Science/phl/master/global_explore/explore_data.html) that will let you explore data directly from the `ohi-global` repository, or modify the `.Rmd` file. In OHI global assessments, Philippines has a region identifier (rgn_id) of 15.

In a few cases, data files are saved locally as `.csv` files for Philippines only because data for all regions are too big and are not kept on GitHub.
